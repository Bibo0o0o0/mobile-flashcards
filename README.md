# Flash Cards project

Flash Cards is a react native project that you use to test your memorization skills against your custom questions.

# This is app is test on android devices only

## Project Setup

1. git clone git@github.com:Bibo0o0o0/mobile-flashcards.git
2. yarn install / npm install

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo Init](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start / yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view the expo interface and run the app on any virtual machine or on your phone if you have the expo application.

The Applicaton will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `expo build:android / expo build:ios`

The two commands build the app for production for android and ios<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/distribution/building-standalone-apps/) for more information.

### `npm run eject / yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
